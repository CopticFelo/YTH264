## Install
### Android
Check the releases tab [Releases](https://github.com/Felo1000110/YTH264/releases) and download the apk from the latest release.

### IOS
Unfortunately, Due to IOS apps requiring an Apple developer certificate to be built and since i am not planning on publishing the app to the App store, You have to build the app from source with your own Developer certificate :<

## Building from source

2. Run ``` Flutter build apk ```

## IOS
1. Install futter -> [Flutter download page](https://flutter-ko.dev/get-started/install).
